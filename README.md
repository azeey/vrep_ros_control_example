vrep_ros_mitsubishi_arm
========================

This package contains a ros_control robot-specific back end for vrep (i.e. ~ gazebo_ros_control but for vrep and for a specific robot). It integrates ros_control in vrep for a 6DOF mitsubishi arm based on the example robot called MyRobot. The package can be adapted to another arm by modifing the URDF.
